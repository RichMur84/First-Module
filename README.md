# First-Module
 Working on my first Module I will do my best to implement what I have leared in bootcamp.

What we will need to do is take an already exixting webpage and see how much better and practical we can make it. Changing attributes and Elements we can structure the webpage as needed in the HTML.

The CSS also need to follow the HTML along and also add COLOR, FONT an IMAGES to make the website pop.
